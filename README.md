# Machine Learning Assignment 1
## Morgan Reilly -- 20235398
### Project Outline
* Research what open-source machine learning packages are available, and select one that you think will be appropriate for this task. Your report should include a brief justification for your choice and an overview of the main features of the package you have chosen. [4 marks max.]
* A dataset is supplied below. You will probably need to do some work to prepare it for input into the ML package, depending on the package’s requirements. Document any data preparation steps in your report. [2 marks max.]
In the ML package, select two different classification algorithms that you will apply to the dataset to learn two different classification models. One of these should be one that we have already covered in lectures (ID3/C4.5 or kNN) while the other should be completely different from those we have already covered. In your report, include a clear description of both algorithms. Ensure that you acknowledge all of your sources of information. [3x2 = 6 marks max.]
* In the ML package, train each of your chosen algorithms using the training set provided in beer_training.txt. You should then test your trained models using the test set provided in beer_test.txt. Report on the results, including the classification accuracy for each model on the training set and on the test set. Also include details of the classification models constructed – these may include graphics if appropriate. [3x2 = 6 marks max.]
* Discuss in your report whether the two models give very similar or significantly different results, and why. [2 marks max.]

### Project Goals
* The goal of your classifier is to predict style (which may be one of three classes: stout, lager or ale) based on the other attributes.
* Your report should not exceed four A4 pages in total. Therefore, take care to ensure that it is succinct and informative, and not overly superficial. This is an individual assignment. As you are all final year or postgraduate students, we will treat any plagiarism (from another student or other sources) very seriously.
